# Weedipedia Mobile App

## Background
The marijuana industry is one of the fastest growing industries at the moment, with new strains and variants being created everyday. This application aims to be a companion app, containing information on over 7,500 strains.

## Data
All of the data was scraped from [Allbud](https://www.allbud.com/) using [BeautifulSoup4](https://pypi.org/project/beautifulsoup4/). The code for this can be found [here](https://github.com/cezar-r/weedipedia/blob/main/src/scraper.py). Each strain is then saved as a [strain](https://github.com/cezar-r/weedipedia/blob/main/src/strain.py) object, which are all stored in a list that is saved as a pickle file to preserve raw data. This data is then [converted to a json file](https://github.com/cezar-r/weedipedia/blob/main/src/datamanager.py)

## Display

## TODO
 - There are still a few updates needed to be made before the app is ready to hit the App Store. Here are some of the updates coming soon:
   - Recent searches - The app will display recent searches made by the user
   - Save strains - A feature that allows users to save strains and view them seperately on another page.
